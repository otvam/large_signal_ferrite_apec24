# Large-Signal Properties in MnZn Ferrites: Code and Data

## Introduction

This repository contains the **datasets** and **code** related to the following **paper**:
* **Characterization and Impact of Large-Signal Dielectric Properties in MnZn Ferrites**
* **Thomas Guillod, William V. R. Roberts, and Charles R. Sullivan**
* **IEEE APEC 2024**

This code simulates the **magnetic-dielectric effects** in a infinitely long **cylindrical core**:
* The (average) flux density through the cross-section is imposed (excitation).
* The material parameters can be amplitude-dependent (locally linearized).

Two different **solvers** are available:
* **Quasi-static** approximation (no wave propagation and spatially independent material parameters).
* **Full wave** solution (with wave propagation and spatially dependent material parameters).

## Main Files

* [paper.pdf](paper.pdf) - PDF of the paper
* [get_param.m](get_param.m) - Definition of the solver parameters
* [run_single.m](run_single.m) - Solve the electromagnetic problem in a core with a given cross-section 
* [run_sweep.m](run_sweep.m) - Solve the electromagnetic problem in cores with different cross-sections
